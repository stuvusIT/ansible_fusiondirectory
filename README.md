# fusiondirectory

This role sets up a FusionDirectory installation.
Only the PHP application is downloaded (on the control machine), extracted and configured.
No data is written to your LDAP server, this has to be done by another role.
Also, you need a PHP-capable webserver which serves `/usr/share/webapps/fusiondirectory`.

The schemas are not touched, [fusiondirectory_schemas](https://github.com/stuvusIT/fusiondirectory_schemas) is used for this.
Your LDAP server needs to have some schemas loaded, see the Requirements section for that.

## Requirements

A dpkg- or pacman-based Linux distribution.

If you are using Arch Linux, [ansible-aur](https://github.com/pigmonkey/ansible-aur) is required.

An LDAP server needs to be configured and have the following schemas loaded:

```
cosine
core-fd
core-fd-conf
template-fd
ldapns
```

Note that some plugins may require more schemas.
